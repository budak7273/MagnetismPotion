<h3>Known Bugs</h3>
<p>For bug reports, please ping <code>robb4</code> in the <code>#modding-chat</code> on the Core Keeper discord.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no "buff icon" for the potion that appears below your Health and Food bars. I assume this is because the <code>Other/ItemPickUpRadius</code> effect is only expected to be on equipment items.</li>
<li>The crafting recipes sometimes appear multiple times. I don't know why this is, but it doesn't seem to break anything. Might be a bug with CoreLib.</li>
</ul>
